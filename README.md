# Cherry-Blossom-10-Mile-Run
In this project, we analyze the data from the Cherry Blossom 10-mile running race from 1973-2022, which took place in Washington DC, in order to elucidate the connection between age and physical fitness with respect to how fast people run. By using R, we processed the data and we found some interesting results about participants.
